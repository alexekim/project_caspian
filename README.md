Project Two: Camping Emergency Info
===================
**Contributors: ** Alex Kim, Maxwell Stern


**Sinatra and Ruby** are the core technologies used in this project. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be implemented in styling the pages.

This project must be a **full-stack** application.

----------
**Project Requirements**
 The app must:

- Have at least 2 models (more if they make sense!) â€“ one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
- Include sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
- Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and interact with your relationally-stored data
- Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
- Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
- Bonus: Be deployed online and accessible to the public


**How Requirements Were Met**
 - nothing yet...


The App
------------
Synopsis:
This can be classified as an Emergency Management app. It is meant to present important In-Case-of-Emergency (ICE) information. The app is meant to be used while camping, and contains the ability to hold information that is specific to the user's trip.

Design Assets
--------
We are looking to build a UI that is very clean for quick reading. We have selected Bootstrap to style our pages. Additionally, we may use unsplash.com as a resource for royalty-free stock imagery.


Pseudocode

this will do that
